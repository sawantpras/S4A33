Correct answer is

f. It is not possible to invoke test() method defined in C from a method in A.

here in all classes method name is same test(). Each class (A,B,C) override method test(). so it is not possible to invoke test() method.



if test () method prototype is different in all classes it is accessed by using super.test();
because class A have all the inherited properties of parent class
